# Delete_History_Automation
A small programme which automatically deletes Browser history choosing the specific options I need in a single click.

Programme may work differently according to screen scaling (positions can be changed easily in source code).

Build using command "go build main.go" and click on main.exe to run. (Select minimized mode in properties).
